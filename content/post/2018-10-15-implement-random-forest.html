<p>I’ve been playing with many different machine/statistical learning models for quite some time and I think I’m now at a point where if I want to keep improving my skills/understanding to the next level, I really need to implement these algorithms from scratch myself.</p>
<p>Random Forest is a classical machine learning algorithm and I have a feeling that it should be relatively easy to implement - it is essentially just a collection of tree models. So as long as I can get one tree model implemented, computer should be able to take the heavy lifting and build up the random forest quite easily. So let’s get started!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>a = 1</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>print(a)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1</code></pre>
