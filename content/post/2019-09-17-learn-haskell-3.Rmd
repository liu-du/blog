```{r echo=FALSE}

```

A recent relevation I had is: all I'm doing when I program is just playing with __Product__ and __Sum__ types. What are them?

tuple is the canonical example of the Product type:
```{haskell}
:t (1 :: Int, "two")
```

the name _Product_ in product type might come from set theory: if we think of integers as one set and strings as another, then we can think of a tuple of type `(Int, String)` as a __cartesian product__ of integer set and string set.

We can see this in other languages as well, for example, in scala's type hierachy, [`Tuple`s inherits from `Product`](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.3/scala/Tuple2.html).

`Either` is the canonical Sum type (a.k.a Coproduct).

```{haskell}
data Either a b = Left a | Right b

```
