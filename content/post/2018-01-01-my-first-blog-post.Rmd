Starting this blog as new year resolution!

While building this blogdown website is made so easy with __blogdown__ package, I did have a difficult time setting up ssh for use. Perhaps I should learn the ssh and do it as my second post? I also want to talk about R, vim, building websites as I learn it. Let's see if I can get this going!
