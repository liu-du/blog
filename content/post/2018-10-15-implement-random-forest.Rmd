I've been playing with many different machine/statistical learning models for quite some time and I think I'm now at a point where if I want to keep improving my skills/understanding to the next level, I really need to implement these algorithms from scratch myself. 

Random Forest is a classical machine learning algorithm and I have a feeling that it should be relatively easy to implement - it is essentially just a collection of tree models. So as long as I can get one tree model implemented, computer should be able to take the heavy lifting and build up the random forest quite easily. So let's get started!

```{r}
a = 1
```

```{r}
print(a)
```
