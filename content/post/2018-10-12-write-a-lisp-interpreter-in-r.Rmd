> How do computer languages work? How can they understand programs and perform computation? 

So, let's implement the famous computer language, Lisp, in R. Or more specifically, let's write an interpreter for lisp language in R. 

Lisp stands for **Lis**t **P**rocessing. As it's name suggests, the programs written in lisp are actually lists and Lisp processes the programs (lists) and give you back an answer.

An interpreter is largely comprised of two parts:

- a parser, whose job is to read in a program written in that language and convert it into an __abstract syntax tree__ s, or __AST__ for short.
- an evaluator, whose job is to evaluate __AST__, that is, run the program! 

It's relatively easy to write a parser for lisp thanks to lisp's pure, simple syntax. 

Now let's visualise
```{r}
repl <- function() {
  repeat {
    a <- readline(prompt = "lispr > ")
    if (a == "exit") break
    print(a)
  }
}
```
