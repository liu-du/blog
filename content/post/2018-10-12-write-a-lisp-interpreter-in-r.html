<blockquote>
<p>How do computer languages work? How can they understand programs and perform computation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, let’s implement the famous computer language, Lisp, in R. Or more specifically, let’s write an interpreter for lisp language in R.</p>
<p>Lisp stands for <strong>Lis</strong>t <strong>P</strong>rocessing. As it’s name suggests, the programs written in lisp are actually lists and Lisp processes the programs (lists) and give you back an answer.</p>
<p>An interpreter is largely comprised of two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>a parser, whose job is to read in a program written in that language and convert it into an <strong>abstract syntax tree</strong> s, or <strong>AST</strong> for short.</li>
<li>an evaluator, whose job is to evaluate <strong>AST</strong>, that is, run the program!</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s relatively easy to write a parser for lisp thanks to lisp’s pure, simple syntax.</p>
<p>Now let’s visualise</p>
<pre class="r"><code>repl &lt;- function() {
  repeat {
    a &lt;- readline(prompt = &quot;lispr &gt; &quot;)
    if (a == &quot;exit&quot;) break
    print(a)
  }
}</code></pre>
