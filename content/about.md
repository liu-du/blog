I am a programming hobbyist, data science/engineering enthusiast. Inspired by [Yihui](https://yihui.name), I realize I should try to write about what I'm learning - it's probably an effective way to turn passive learning into active/creative thinking and consolidate my thoughts. I also hope my posts can help others as well as helping me. And I wish to connect with people who share similar passions.

I currently work as a Data Engineer at WooliesX, Sydney. My work experience includes applying various statistical models to get insights from data in insurance/retail industry, building recommendation engine using machine learning models and building data pipelines with cloud and big data solutions.
