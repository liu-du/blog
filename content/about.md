I am a programming hobbyist, data science enthusiast and self-motivated learner. I'm currently working as a Data Scientist at QBE in Sydney, previously I worked as an actuarial analyst/consultant at Taylor Fry. I studied actuarial science and statistics at the Australian National University.

Inspired by [Yihui](https://yihui.name), I realize I should try to write about what I'm learning - it could be an effective way to turn passive learning into active/creative thinking and consolidate my thoughts. I also hope my posts can help others as well as helping me. And I wish to connect with people who share similar passions.
