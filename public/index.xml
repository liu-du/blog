      <description>IntroRecently, I am studying The Elements of Statistical Learning out of my own interest. An interesting topic they covered briefly on their online videos is bootstrap. Bootstrap, in the simplest terms, is the process of generating samples from sample. Say you collected a sample of n data points, a bootstrap sample is generated by sampling n data points from the original sample you collected with replacement. (So Given a sample size of n, you are able to generate \(n^n\) bootstrap samples.</description>

      <description>When developing a package or a set of functions, you often needs a lot of options. Often, you would want to set some sensible defaults for each option whilst giving users the flexibility to customize and extend. Take ggplot2 for example, if you ever used it, you know the background of the plots is, by default, grey, though You have the flexibility to change it.
While there are many ways to set options, I haven’t found a summary of pros and cons of different approaches and I certainly don’t know what best practices are.</description>

      <description>I am a learner.
haha!!
One day I realized I should try to write about what I learned - it could be an effective way to turn passive learning into active/creative thinking. I also hope to share my findings and random thoughts with people and find people who share passions with me.</description>

Starting this blog as new year resolution!
While building this blogdown website is made so easy with blogdown package, I did have a difficult time setting up ssh for use. Perhaps I should learn the ssh and do it as my second post? I also want to talk about R, vim, building websites as I learn it.</description>
