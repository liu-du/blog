      <description>When developing a package or a set of functions, you often needs a lot of options. Ideally you would often want to set some sensible defaults for each option whilst giving the user the flexibility to customize and extend. Take ggplot2 for example, if you ever plot any plots with it, you know the background of the plots is, by default, grey. However, you have the flexibility to change it. theme_set function allows you to customize it.</description>

Starting this blog as new year resolution!
While building this blogdown website is made so easy with blogdown package, I did have a difficult time setting up ssh for use. Perhaps I should learn the ssh and do it as my second post? I also want to talk about R, vim, building websites as I learn it.</description>
